# HTML Builder 2.0
---
HTML Builder Lite takes a block oriented approach to building web pages and web sites. What this is means is that  HTML Builder Lite provides the user with a selection of pre-designed blocks, such as headers, content sections, forms, footers, etc. which are combined onto a canvas to create fully functional web page.
